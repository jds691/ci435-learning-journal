                    Purpose and motivation, in this context, refers to the ability to avoid procrastination and boredom
                    and to efficiently break down your work into manageable chunks that you are able to complete with
                    focus and dedication.

        <h2>How I developed this skill</h2>
        <p>
            The University of Brighton provides all students with access to the Brighton Student Skills hub. This hub
            allows students to review some articles helping them to develop a variety of essential skills for university
            life. One of the skills it mentioned was purpose and motivation which I knew was something I needed to
            develop further.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key things it talked about was how to get started with work and what to focus on first. A
            technique it talked about was preparing everything before you start your work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally, I set up my workstation with all the required apps and resources I needed and I made a list in
            my reminders app on my phone of the tasks I needed to complete which I organised from toughest to easiest so
            that after completing a hard task, all of the subsequent tasks would seem easier. I also went out for a walk
            to my local coffee shop to get a drink and snack so that when I came back to my workstation I would be back
            with a clear and focused mind so that I could settle into work easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another important part of motivation is preventing boredom. Work, for the majority of people, is not fun.
            People want to get rewarded for their hard work in the moment rather than later in the form of a grade. The
            Student Skills Hub mentioned two ways to do this that I found particularly useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Break longer tasks into multiple shorter ones. This worked well for me since I use the Pomodoro technique
            whilst I work, which involves working for short periods of time to then later receive a small break. By
            breaking my tasks down, it meant that I could complete one of those small tasks within a single pomodoro
            session which made me feel accomplished after only a small amount of work.
        </p>
        <p>
            One place I used this was in my CI405 assessment. It required us to complete a variety of questions each
            week as well as some practical tasks, instead of seeing the whole weeks work as one tasks I broke it down
            into a task for each question and another one for the practical. I felt very accomplished as one session was
            enough time to answer a question and also some extra time to prepare my response for the next one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another technique was setting up my space for studying, this meant removing distractions so that I wouldn’t
            see something and want to play with it or go do something else. To achieve this I worked in the Aldrich
            library a lot of the time which is a part of the Cockroft building. I typically went late at night where
            there wasn’t that many people around so that I was able to maximise my focus.
        </p>
        <h2>Reflecting on Semester One</h2>
        <div class="multi-column-container">
            <h3>What went well?</h3>
            <p>
                After developing this skill further I can confidently say that I am good at managing my workload and
                effectively breaking down tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have developed great time management skills and I have been able to reliably keep up with my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whilst improving my work ethic and ability to work well, I have also been able to prioritise my social
                life and enjoy my life as a student with my friends which is due to the rate at which I have been able
                to pick up the material and practically apply it in all of my modules.
            </p>

            <h3>What could have been improved?</h3>
            <p>
                One area I struggled with is understanding the material being taught. I did not speak up enough during
                the labs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, during my lectures I did not pay enough attention and therefore did not take detailed
                enough notes. This resulted in me having to often watch lectures again outside of classes and redoing
                all of the notes I had taken.
            </p>
            <p>
                This ultimately resulted in wasted time which could’ve been saved.
