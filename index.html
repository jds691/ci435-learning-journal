            <p>
                This week, we started the basic project structure of the website. I've never done HTML before, so it
                was very weird at first understanding how to structure my project files (I had to remake my Git
                repository a couple of times...) but nevertheless I got the project made.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most important thing I learnt this week was about semantics. I was loosely familiar with this
                concept from my experience working with Apple Wallet, but I wasn't sure exactly what it meant. As it
                turns out semantics are very useful! Semantics were introduced with HTML5 and provide a better
                description of what element of each webpage does.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, there is the &lt;header&gt; element
                now. This tells the browser that this is the main title area, the heading for the webpage. Previously
                we had to markup loads of &lt;div&gt; elements with various CSS class attributes which weren't very
                clear. However, web browsers thankfully still support older elements so that the treasure trove of
                existing web pages aren't lost to time. It also reduced the accessibility of a webpage
                by making it harder for users to apply custom style sheets that make webpages easier for them to use
                as the class attribute could be inconsistent from page to page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of accessibility, I never knew there were so many standards for the web. The W3C maintains
                the primary set of standards for a webpage to abide by, in order to make web-based experiences rich,
                open and accessible. You can view these standards <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">here</a>.
                Accessibility means a lot to many people, and I'm glad to see that there are various standards in
                place to keep the web open and welcoming to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                To end off, I would like to keep a record of the visual progress of the website. Currently, all
                webpages look nearly identical but over time as I learn CSS I hope for these pages to look amazing.
            </p>
