            <p>
                This week, we started the basic project structure of the website. I've never done HTML before,
                so it was very weird at first understanding how to structure my project files but nevertheless
                I got the project made and learnt about the very basics of web development.
            </p>
            <h4>Making the Web Pages</h4>
            <p>
                To get started, we were provided with a template HTML document to work with.
                We were tasked with making 3 copies of this and naming them: index, contact and tutorial.
                Each of these pages have different requirements that I need to implement.
                I created my project locally in my IDE and decided to have the upload for when I was finished this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                One requirement this week was to link all of these web pages together.
                This is done via &lt;a&gt; elements, or anchor elements. Anchor elements take a href attribute that
                tells web browser where to navigate to when the element is clicked. I initially wrote my elements as:
            </p>
            <p>
                &lt;a href=”/index.html”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
                This worked perfectly locally as every webpage was beside each other in the directory.
                However, when I uploaded these pages to Brighton Domains all the links broke.
                This is because by adding the “/” to the start of the path, it pointed the browser to the root of the
                website instead of the specific folder that I decided to store my project in. There was a very simple
                fix for this. When removing the “/” it instructs to browser to locate a file with that name inside the
                current directory, this would be the same as adding “./” to the start of the path.
            </p>
            <h4>Semantics</h4>
            <p>
                The most important thing I learnt this week was about semantics. I was loosely familiar with this
                concept from my experience working with Apple Wallet, but I wasn't sure exactly what it meant. As it
                turns out semantics are very useful! Semantics were introduced with HTML5 and provide a better
                description of what element of each webpage does.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, there is the &lt;header&gt; element now. This tells the browser that this is the main
                title area, the heading for the webpage. Previously we had to markup loads of &lt;div&gt; elements with
                various CSS class attributes which weren't very clear. However, web browsers thankfully still
                support older elements so that the treasure trove of existing web pages aren't lost to time. It also
                reduced the accessibility of a webpage by making it harder for users to apply custom style sheets
                that make webpages easier for them to use as the class attribute could be inconsistent from page to
                page.
            </p>
            <h4>Accessibility</h4>
            <p>
                Speaking of accessibility, I never knew there were so many standards for the web. The W3C maintains
                the primary set of standards for a webpage to abide by, to make web-based experiences rich, open and
                accessible. These are known as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">W3C standards</a>.
                Accessibility means a lot to many people, and I'm glad to see that there are various standards in
                place to keep the web open and welcoming to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the W3C provides a tool known as the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup
                Validation Service</a> that allows you to check if your website is W3C standards compliant. It is
                something I will be using extensively during my projects development as I know it is important. Not
                only for accessibility but also for CSS to function as expected.
            </p>
            <!--Add a ref for Git, WebStorm, Remote Deployment-->
            <h4>Further Research</h4>
            <p>
                In previous projects I sometimes made changes to them that caused major components to break without
                my knowledge and when I later went back to the system, I was unaware of the exact changes and so it
                took quite some time to debug my problems and repair the system. I knew for this assessment that I
                needed to change my workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project I decided to integrate <a href="https://git-scm.com/about">Git</a> into my workflow.
                Git is a version control system that allows you to take snapshots of your project so that you can
                track, and rollback changes made to a project over time. It is used a lot in the industry and is also
                very common amongst open-source developers. My IDE of choice for this project was <a
                    href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm by IntelliJ</a> which has very robust Git
                integration alongside various automations that aid me in development. The initial commits of my
                project were very messy as I was still trying to understand how to make a “good” commit but
                eventually (after reinitialising the repository a lot) I made the repository clean, and I am now
                keeping better track of my projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I researched more into the capabilities of WebStorm. I found out that it has a built-in
                SFTP client that allows me to interact with the web server and its contents without needing to leave
                the IDE. It also has an automation that allows me to automatically upload the current commit of my
                local repository to Brighton Domains without needing to log in or change the files directly. This has
                already saved me a lot of time and means that I do not need to rely on a hosting service like GitHub
                for storing my project.
            </p>

                <h4>Progress Snapshot</h4>
            </a>
            <p>
                To end off, I would like to keep a record of the visual progress of the website. Currently, all
                webpages look nearly identical but over time as I learn CSS I hope for these pages to look amazing.

                This week we learnt more elements of HTML and how a web browser handles them and exposes them to
                JavaScript. The Document Object Model (DOM) is where all HTML elements are stored to when processed
                by the browser. This exposes the element and basic properties to JavaScript via the Document class,
                where elements can be looked up using ids and classes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also learnt about many new tags this week. Including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;strong&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;em&gt;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These elements are a part of semantics. There used to be elements for bold or italics, but these
                elements rarely gave context to the meaning behind what they were doing. Elements also have to be
                specifically structured and organised so the browser knows when one element has ended so that another
                can start. This is why <em>most</em> elements have an opening and a closing tag, where the closing
                tag is written like &lt;p/&gt;. Some elements however are self-closing, for example &lt;img&gt;, this
                is just written using the opening tag with no '/' symbol at the end (this is a W3C validation error).
            </p>
            <p>
                To end off, there are no real changes to the website appearance. So if you want to see what the site
                looked like at week 2, I encourage you to look at the <a
                    href="#week1-snapshot">week 1 screenshots</a>.

                This week we went more in-depth on the DOM and common patterns that web developers use. We also
                learnt how to create tables and make content look better with formatting. Additionally, we learnt a
                little bit about how to optimise content for mobile devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, we learnt about a new type of list. The description list. Its purpose is to describe a
                list of items, similar to a glossary. From now on, I'll be listing elements that I have learnt more
                about using this list. So lets start that, here are the elements I have learnt more about this week:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>&lt;nav&gt;</dt>
                <dd>
                    Represents the main navigation area of the page. This could be a part of a top bar or in the
                    sidebar of the webpage.
                </dd>
                <dt>&lt;aside&gt;</dt>
                <dd>
                    Commonly represents a sidebar or similar content. It's usually not an element that is a part of
                    the page you are looking at but rather an element that is present throughout most of the site
                    e.g. Sidebar.
                </dd>
                <dt>&lt;footer&gt;</dt>
                <dd>
                    Commonly reserved for contact information, references or dates. Something that usually isn't too
                    important to the main content of the web page.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <!--Potentially add the Mozilla docs as a reference instead of a link in this paragraph?-->
            <!--Also add a reference to the legal requirement-->
            <p>
                Apparently the reason all of these elements have their own recommendations for content to put in them
                is because it aids in the ability of screen readers and keyboard navigation to reliably navigate your
                website. So far I am using my elements based on the recommended usages provided by Mozilla. They
                maintain an index of all the HTML elements including deprecated and experimental elements. These
                standards are followed by web developers and are also considered to be acceptable to meet the legal
                requirement of making websites accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next I learnt about the various types of selectors. Selectors are used by JavaScript and CSS to
                manipulate web content. They come in the form of the "id" and "class" attributes on HTML elements.
                Whilst they appear to serve similar functions, they are very different. Here is a table indicating
                the various differences:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>id</th>
                    <th>class</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Uniqueness</td>
                    <td>Only used once</td>
                    <td>Used multiple times</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Use</td>
                    <td>Uniquely identify an element</td>
                    <td>Perform styling and modifications to a group of elements</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Accessed by</td>
                    <td>JavaScript and CSS</td>
                    <td>JavaScript and CSS</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <!--https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp-->
            <p>
                It took me longer than I would like to admit to understand how tables work... I am much more familiar
                with Markdown tables, so I had to follow a guide from W3Schools.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last main thing I learnt this week was about meta information. In the lecture we learnt about the
                &lt;meta&gt; element, specifically the viewport meta. Meta elements, according to Mozilla, represents
                metadata information about a web page that cannot be displayed via standard HTML elements e.g. the
                web page title displayed on this pages tab. The viewport meta element allows the website to be
                displayed better on mobile because the width of the website is now laid out based upon screen width.
            </p>
            <p>
                To end off, I would like to illustrate the difference that has been made just by adding the viewport
                modifier. As you can see the text looks narrower to match the phone width, the reason this displays
                small still is due to the size of the screenshots on the page. Hopefully with a bit of CSS next week
                this can be fixed!
            </p>
